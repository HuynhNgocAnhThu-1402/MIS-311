# MIS-311 — Data Analysis and Insight Project

## 📊 Project Overview
This repository showcases my Part 1 project for **MIS 311 – Introduction to Business Analytics** at Eastern International University.

The project analyzes the **Supermarket Sales Dataset**, focusing on data cleaning, descriptive statistics, and key business insights such as:
- Comparison of sales revenue between branches  
- Differences in average spending by customer type  

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Removed 12 rows with missing values in key columns (`quantity`, `customer_type`, `product_category`)
- Removed 3 duplicate rows  
- Verified correct data types for all variables  
- Final dataset: **239 rows × 8 columns**

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- **Branch A** generated ~140% more revenue than Branch B  
- **Members** spend ~22% more per transaction than normal customers  
- Spending distribution shows right-skewness → few high-value customers significantly affect revenue
